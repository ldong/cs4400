CS 4400: Intro to Database
======
###Course Contents:
We introduce the fundamental concepts necessary for the design and use of modern database systems. We examine the concepts in the order that we encounter them in the actual database design process. We start with the problem of conceptually representing data that is to be stored in a database. From there, we see how the data in a conceptual data model can be converted to a database specific model (e.g., the relational data model). We also discuss various forms for relations that possess good properties. We see how to use the relational database language SQL to define the relations and to write SQL statements to insert, delete, retrieve and update the data. We also examine some of the fundamental storage structures that are used in relational database systems. We end the course with a discussion of some advanced topics in the database management area.
###PROJECT Description:
You will design and implement a database application using the MySQL/PHP relational database system available via CoC (College of Computing). The Project must be done in groups of 3-4 students. You are allowed to form groups across the three sections of the class.  We will follow a typical database design methodology for this project. Notes describing the methodology will be available via the class web page. The project will consist of 3 phases (deliverables) as well as a final demonstration to the TA. Phase I and Phase II of the project are each worth 10% credit. Phase III of the project is worth 20% credit with/GUI.  All members of a group get the same grade for each phase of the project.  If a member of a group does not carry his/her weight, then the group may kick out that member at the end of phase I or Phase II, only. The course professors and head TA should be notified of this.


This is a class project for GT cs4400 taken students @ FALL 2012.
